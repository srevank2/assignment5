Part2-a (manual review of IPower.java) - timestamped commit:
- Issue: method computePower uses magic numbers and no overflow checks -> recommend document behaviour or use long/BigInteger.
- Issue: method names unclear (powCalc -> toPower), recommend clearer naming and JavaDoc.
- Issue: public static mutable fields (if present) -> make private + accessor or make immutable.
- Issue: high cyclomatic complexity in method X (refactor: extract helper methods).
- Issue: missing null-checks for inputs -> add guards or document preconditions.
- Recommended fixes: add JavaDoc, replace magic numbers with constants, reduce method complexity, handle overflow or document limits, encapsulate fields.
